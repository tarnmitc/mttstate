		<h1>A Sustainable Tomorrow</h1>
    <p>Hey throw that away. Just toss it in the trash. A common expression in our society that is often thoughtless. A lot of us think they are portals to another dimension, some other planet that was destined to be a wasteland. What really happens when you throw something away? What are the consequences of your actions? I have news, there is no portal, that destined wasteland is us. </p>
    <p>The purpose of this essay is to define ecological problems we have created including the BP oil spill and analyzing the norms of society regarding the environment, the dominant social paradigm. Why rejection and adaptation of social behaviors through social change and technological advancements are necessary to achieve a sustainable society.</p>
    <p>Environmental problems have been around ever since the industrial revolution. Humans are an infestation on planet earth that are abusing resources and are only just starting to realize it. Someone who realized the ecological tightrope we are walking is Josh Tickell and his wife Rebecca, the makers of the documentary “The Big Fix”. After the BP oil spill that claimed 11 lives and spilled 210 million gallons of oil the couple knew they had to do something. They headed to Louisiana to see the spill for themselves. When they arrived officials promptly stopped them. All the beaches looked clean from afar. Close-ups were only allowed in restricted areas of the beach as if this charade was designed to fill the amusement of a tourist much as a museum or Broadway show, only seen from one side. While the rest of the media took this petty act for what it was Josh took us behind the scenes to see things off the radar. He exposed simply buried oil, decomposing whales and other wildlife brutally murdered by carelessness of corporations. </p>
    <p>Wildlife is not the only thing that suffered from this disaster. Local families also suffered. Something at the foundation of Louisiana and Mississippi’s culture, something vital to their economy was taken away: the fishing industry. The crab, crawfish, alligator, shrimp and oysters caught in Louisiana alone account for 30 percent of the seafood caught in the US. BP changed that. Just as if you removed krill from the sea the whale perishes, the loss of small creatures like shrimp caused the whole ecosystem to crash feeling a ripple effect past the ecosystem and into the economy. With the fall of shrimp and other creatures so went the top of the economical food chain: local and national companies that sold them. Dean Blanchard was especially hit hard. Dean, a long time business owner and a shrimp processor conveyed, “I fought for 20 some years and now I’m the last one left. I don’t know if we will ever shrimp again” shrimping was Dean’s way of life BP did not only destroy their business but others as well.</p>
    <p>BP was a very fast growing and the fifth largest company in the world, in addition they have one of the worst safety records. BP cut corners to get to where they are. After doing more damage than half a decade worth of hurricanes one might ask, why are they still at the top after something so tragic? Looking to the government for answers, none were found. After all they are the ones who are supposed to prevent this and at least discipline the company. Instead we see senators and congressmen turning the other cheek. This is because they were paid to do so. The Kochs are powerful family in the oil industry. In 2010 (the year of the oil spill) they gave 198 million dollars to candidates. In this modern era of politics where “a war chest” of money is needed to win an election the Kochs money and other major industries interested in having legislation written in their favor is mandatory for political victory.  Of the 1216 candidates 1053 winners were funded by the Kochs. This means the oil industry has majority of the government officials in their back pocket. And if one of the elected gets out of hand the industry can just sick a lobbyist on them. The official only needs to defeat 400 people to keep his opinion (lobbyist to chairman ratio 400:1). These lobbyists are not some low class individuals either. The total lobbyist income for 2010 was 11.8 million dollars. (The Big Fix)</p>
