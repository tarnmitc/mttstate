		<h1>Writing as a Way of Life</h1>
    <p>My idea of writing and personal literacy has changed over time. Once as simple as making it through a picture book now has turned into a complex and challenging discipline that kept me working. For me it is now something that I work on constantly, storytelling has become an art. I am currently trying my hand at songwriting. Writing is something you will use every day of your life and will not go away. Writing is more than just scribbling down words mindlessly. It becomes a maze and a challenge to clearly portray ideas in your head as written word. This first year college writing course has helped me expand my horizons in this field and become more affluent and effective with writing. the skills I have learned in this class will help me in my professional life as well. This class has encouraged me to keep writing outside of this class with setting up things like a blog and also taught me a basic understanding of how to build and maintain a website.  </p>
    <p>The class is outlined in five projects. Lived Experiences, Cultural Analysis, Formal Research, Remix Project and this one, the Course Retrospective, each project teaches you very different things. </p>
    <p>The Lived Experiences project is unique and contrasts high school writing in the sense that you can write about whatever you want in a writing style that was new to me, a personal narrative. This paper will teach you how truly hard it is to make a spoken story into a written story.  This paper emphasizes grammar and an informal tone. To make a good story you need to know when to pause when to go into more detail and when to rush trough a part. Grammar is very important because we talk nothing like we write.  To get those perfectly timed pauses and use pathos writing as effective as possible you must use grammar. People say that a joke is 90% delivery. The same goes with a paper. Grammar is the dividing line between a good story and a great story; use it wisely and the paper will be taken to the next level. </p>
    <p>The Lived Experiences paper made me learn a lot and you won’t stop learning in the next project either, The Cultural Analysis paper. This paper is challenging because of the increased length. In this ____________ paper organization and focus is very important. You will need to transition from point to point seamlessly and effectively for the reader to come away with an overwhelming main point of your essay.  One of the main things I noticed from high school to college writing is the length you have to complete a paper and the time it takes to write them; the time you have is greatly decreased and the responsibility is greatly increased. With large papers it is better to get working on them right away, the freedom of this hybrid class is very nice but if you are not S.M.A.R.T. (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound) with your goals you will quickly find yourself overwhelmed and stressed. </p>
    <p>The Formal Research paper is next and the longest paper you will write. Although you do not get the freedom to pick your own topic you learn a lot about your major. This paper requires you to explore the difficulty of the disciplines in your major. You will cover the topics of reading writing and research.  Two interviews are also required to integrate into your paper. This opportunity allows you to ask questions that you may have. I asked questions that I knew I could not use in my paper but had to do with my future. Everyone always has something they wish they did differently and are willing to give you advice. Through asking questions like these you can be better prepared for your future. In addition to interviews students were also required to read and explain scholarly artifacts from their major. This helps you become better acquainted with the things and learn what it takes to be successful. This project helped me understand my major and get a glimpse into my future.</p>
    <p>And the Remix project. The remix project was a completely new medium for me and presented a need for a new set of skills that I would have to learn. This project involves taking an old project and transmending it into a new medium in our case a video. In this video we had to use video of course but in addition everything else someone making a high quality entertaining video would use like pictures music text and voiceovers. The real challenge came when I recorded the video. For one it was difficult to tell a story to a camera but after all the information was put together we had about 50 pictures and 45 minutes of video for a 9-minute requirement. Good editing is the thing that makes the remix project. I think we did a good job and I got quite familiar with iMovie. Not only did this project teach you how to edit but it also encouraged working together. This group project furthered my understanding on how to get things done effectively in a group. The things we did and forms of communication we established lead to a project done and polished well in advance. First thing we did was establish a group text. Any questions were brought up in the group text or things that people needed to know. Secondly we created “living” documents through Google drive a document that updates in real time while all of us can edit it. Thirdly we created imaginary due dates to keep the group on task and on track. I found a lot of things new and helpful that my group and I tried out. One of the hardest things in groups is that one person seems to be doing the majority of the work. I learned the motivating force behind getting things done and a good way of keeping the workloads even, accountability.  Accountability makes everyone responsible for what they have to do. by reminding your group mates and explicitly telling them what to do will get the fire lit within them and has lead to this project and many of mine run very smoothly. </p>
    <p>Lastly The Course Retrospective Project. This project consists of one class coming together to make a website and the content that goes in it. Four groups go over the four papers, one group for each paper and the fifth group is the web development team. I was on the web development team, although this avenue of the project does not have any real writing formal writing to it emphasizes the second part of the course name Science and Technology with doing something a little different called coding. Coding is like writing in another language telling the computer what to do. Using coding in the “language” of CSS and HTML my group was able to create something usable and presentable to a group. This project is the last thing we do in the class and will really hone your skills either as a writer or in my case a web developer. </p>
    <p>Although the main focus of this course is writing students learned a lot about technology as well. Everyone is familiar with the internet and visits websites daily but not everyone knows what goes into making something like that. In WRA with Miss Daniels we learned how to build and maintain a website. With this course we were required to start coding and start to form a basic understanding of CSS and HTML. After we learned the basics we were also required to post all papers to our website. I never knew how much tedious work goes into making a simple button on a website and getting it to work flawlessly. In addition to our papers on our website we were required to have an active blog as well. In this blog you get to experience the freedom of writing in a free form blog. This newly learned skill is something I found challenging and rewarding at the same time. I can now sit back and look at the website I built and be proud that I learned how to do that from nothing. This class has taught me a lot and one lesson from coding is hard work and persistence pays off.</p>
    <p>This class is challenging, this class will test you and this class will take some time, more than most of the level one writing classes at Michigan state but with the increased difficulty comes reward. Learning new skills like how to build a website is not only what college is about but I can also mention these skills on a job application. If you take the same attitude that you should in all of your studies; managed hard work and time commitment, the grades will show and your efforts will pay off.
