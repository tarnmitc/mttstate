		<h1>A Sustanable Tomorrow cont.</h1>
    
    <p>Conservation is a personal choice that we all must make that is critical to a future society. To make room for the future and for each other we all must do our part this means anything from taking sorter showers, turning off the water when brushing your teeth, changing your light bulbs, buying green and recycling. With conservation of resources there are more to pass around for others or leave to harvest for the future. Coming from a rural community I never recycled, it was not an option. Places like MSU and New Zealand have lots of opportunities for eco friendly personal choices including multiple recycle bins for papers, plastics, metals and food scraps. MSU puts a garbage bin out but there is a subtle thing that makes a difference; a sticker saying landfill. With this sticker they reinforce and provide an answer to where this trash is going. Making people think about what they are doing and actions past their immediate ones causing a change in outcome. With changes like this and a social enlightenment about the environment including why we should conserve, will help us retain the resources we have creating a better future for tomorrow. (Pielke)</p>
    <p>Protection is important in maintaining a sustainable environment as well. More specifically the governments roll in protecting the environment. The government has a responsibility to protect the people in all aspects including protection from themselves. It’s the government’s job through regulation to prevent destructive behaviors like the tragedy of the commons. The government can pass legislation that prohibits manufacture of cars with large carbon footprints. Trading carbon is also an option. Carbon trading is putting a price tag on emissions by large corporations and the ability to reverse their carbon footprint by buying things with a negative carbon footprint like forests, making forests worth more alive than dead. Another thing we could do is use balanced harvesting in the fishing industry instead of size selective fishing (only keeping the big fish). Size selective fishing has caused the size of commercial fish to be unintentionally cut in half over the last 40 years. Balanced harvesting fishing takes a proportionate amount of fish of every size solving the consequences of selective fishing. Along with all the problems we face one needs to be changed: the oil industry. The things the government allows the deregulated industry is more harmful than the public knows. Not only harmful to us but to the future of the human race. Without becoming more sustainable through safety measures and legislation we will have nothing for tomorrow. These are some of the things the government could do and it is up to the people in charge, the people we elect, to make an informed decision and represent the masses. </p>
    <p>Yet the heads of government want to solve the problems of the people and look to the political agenda to see what is important to their constituents. Without properly informed civilians we can not prevent disasters. Education is necessary and the most important part of changing this taker path we are set down. Nelson Mandela said, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” Using Mandela’s logic teaching students about the rapidly declining environment and the students will change the world. When I went through high school I was taught global warming as a theory, eh it could be happening or it could be the path of the earth or something, now lets memorize 50 types of rocks. We need informed citizens that know that global warming is real, global warming is happening now, global warming can be slowed and we can crate a sustainable society. If you look throughout history we can find examples of amazing things done with the power of youth and unity. In 2012 a spark was ignited by a single youtube video informing about the dictator Joseph Koney. Because people cared, because what was happening was exposed, Kony was removed from power. The same thing can be done with the environment. The solution to our problems starts in the school systems teaching students things like the impact of an oil spill and the impact of greenhouse gasses, what can be done and why it is important. If we take this critical step in the what is now broken system we will have a democracy that elects officials that will make the choices to be green and set us in the right direction.  </p>
    <p>The environment is extremely complex and humankind has a long way to go before we become a sustainable society. When talking about fixing the environment Congressman and citizens get overwhelmed with solving such a big question and do not take any action. It is our responsibility to express this urgent matter and start taking one little step at a time both legislatively and personally… How will you respond to “Hey, throw that away”?</p>
