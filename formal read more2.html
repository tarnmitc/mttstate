    <p>Reading and staying up to date is not voluntary it is necessary to keep your license. Nurses have to renew their state license every 2 years. Nurses and doctors do this by earning 25 CEU’s, which are credits towards their license, by going to seminars, meetings, and courses where they learn difficult new things about nursing within their practice. Dr. Tarn informs, “It is vital that I keep up with nationwide trends in my chosen field.  No longer can a physician (or nurse) just say, ‘because that's the way we've always done it.’ you must have sound research based evidence to apply in everyday practice in all medical fields. “ The medical field is one that is always innovating. In one lifespan we went from discovering blood cells to creating aspirin. </p>
    <p>Through technological and medical advancements we have been able to do some amazing things along with things that have been ethically challenged like growing human organs on animals and genetic manipulation. Genetic manipulation is of growing interest and benefit but has its obvious ethical dilemmas of messing with things that are of the natural order. Some of the things genetic manipulation/modification or genetic engineering have allowed us to do is identify and fix diseases like insulin deficiencies and prolong life in rats by 25%. The field of genetic modification is new and has not fully been explored. The things we may be able to do is astounding like using our own skin after it is transferred back to stem cells to regrow spinal cords. This technology although risky and standing on ethically shaky grounds could prove to be the breakthrough and cause an increase in quality of life amongst the disabled. </p>
    <p>Research</p>
    <p>Research in medicine is much different than the things you read in school. Mrs. O’Berski said, “Although, I don’t analyze research papers regularly, I do use research in my practice of nursing. How I utilize research in my practice is based on the recommendations of formal organizations that conduct the research. For example the American Heart Association or American Nursing Association will review the research on certain subjects and give recommendations to help both physicians and nurses treat and care for patients.  For example, the American Orthopedic Association no longer recommends giving a pre-med antibiotic before dental procedures for patients with a prosthetic joint. This new recommendation was based on research.” Dr. Thomas Tarn goes on to add, ”There is a major focus in the healthcare field to practice ‘evidence based medicine.’ Insurance companies in particular will reject payment on any procedures, drugs or therapies that are not based on sound clinical research.” Reaserch is the driving foundation to the constantly innovating field of medicine. Research studies are something you will be affected by everyday. Before a drug can be put in use there are rigorous studies that must be conducted mandated by federal administrations like the FDA. Research is something that all doctors base their treatment on and the only thing insurance companies will accept.</p>
    <p>Staying stress free</p>
    <p>Nursing can be a stressful job. Keeping the sick alive can be a challenge especially and when “they try to die on you” Dr. Thomas Tarn said, “On the job, as an anesthesiologist, I certainly have stressful moments and days.  There's no question that experience in my job has helped in my decision making and problem solving skills in critical situations.  Compared to my first few years on the job I am much more able to keep a cool head when difficult situations arise based on the experience of providing 1000's of anesthetics over the last 17 years.” Dr. Tarn uses the practice how you play theory to medicine. If you stand in back let the senor members administer the iv or the fellow residents in your position you will not be prepared when it is your time to shine. Practice makes perfect. Mrs. O’Berski takes a slightly different strategy to it, “The best way for me to handle stress in my job is to be prepared.  Preparation includes having knowledge of the job and the skills necessary to do the job properly. In nursing this means having knowledge of disease processes and potential patient responses to their illness, medications, and /or procedures.  Having a rigorous curriculum helps a nurse to gain the knowledge to perform their job with confidence.” Medicine can be a stressful occupation. Things happen in surgery that are unexpected, everyone reacts differently to medications, and our insides are just as diverse as our outsides. One way to reduce stress is be prepared, know what you are doing and have confidence in yourself. If you take these steps, look at the puzzle pieces and put as many of them together as you can you can reduce stress and in turn increase the success rate of surgeries. </p>
    <p>Adaptability</p>
    <p>With over 104 specialties in the nursing field there is something out there for everyone. One of the things everyone has suggested is find the right thing for you Dr. Sandra Spoelstra, an assistant professor at Michigan State University says, “There are so many different opportunities in nursing. When some get in school, undergraduate students are usually think ‘Oh, I like this part of nursing so I think I will do this’ and then they explore a new aspect of nursing and think ‘I like this one better!’ You have to find what you truly like. It is important to explore all of the options in nursing before you truly decide what you want to do” Dr. Tarn Further explains, “I think the great thing about medicine is the are so many sub-specialties that they is something for everyone. Personality types certainly lend themselves to certain fields.” One of the fields of interest is nurse anesthetist. A certified registered nurse anesthetist or CRNA cares for a patient before, during and after a medical procedure or surgery by performing a patient assessment, preparing the patient for anesthesia, administering and maintaining the anesthesia to ensure proper sedation and pain management, overseeing patient recovery from anesthesia and caring for the patient's immediate post-operative needs. Dr. Tarn provides more incite into this specialization, “Being an Anesthesiologist or Nurse Anesthetist tend to attract people that are a bit of adrenaline junkies. There is a saying that working in anesthesia is ‘90% boredom and 10% panic.’ Not only do you have to be prepared for the 10% part ... You have to like it and even look forward to it a little bit.”  CRNA and medical professions in the emergency room provide a different atmosphere than a family practice nurse. With they array of specialties this field allows there is something for everyone.</p>
    <p>Rewards of nursing </p>
    <p>Nursing is a difficult field with a lot of work heartache and pain so why would someone choose a profession in this field? The health care professionals that take care of a patient have a tremendous opportunity in front of them. Make someone walk again, without help they would not be able to. Save a mans life with a new liver or an operation on his heart. When someone saves a life the opportunities are endless the butterfly effect takes place and the things that person can do and the changes they can make are endless. Even if they do not go on to cure caner or solve world hunger there is an amazing joy and appreciation in a family to have their grandfather for a few more years is worth the hard work one must put forth to become a physician. Dr. Tarn says, “It is tremendously satisfying making patients as pain free as possible through major surgeries.  Making post-op rounds and talking with my patients the day after surgery is one of the best parts of my job.” Dr. Tarn gets to see first hand the lives he has saved the families and the people he has affected. Nursing may be challenging, it may be a long haul but the satisfaction nurses get and the difference you make is well worth it. </p>
