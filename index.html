		  <h1>Welcome To My Website</h1> 
          <p>Welcome to my new website for my first year writing class at Michigan State University! I am very excited to start this new project.  The skills I learn in this class will help me maintain or build a website in my future!</p>
          <p> I look forward to learning more throughout the class about HTML and CSS.</p>
           <p>As for me I am a freshman at Michigan State and have been blessed with many opportunities one of the things I did this summer and you see above is me in New Zealand! This was one of the best trips of my life.  The first picture of me on the bench is during a seal safari along the cost of the north island and ill tell you what those seals are lazy made of strait blubber and smell! It was extremely beautiful there and I really just wanted to spend the rest of the day on that bench.</p>
           <p> The second picture is of me standing on some old war bunkers overlooking the city of Wellington, New Zealand. One of my friends I met on the trip and I went up into the mountains and came across them. The way up was difficult and we knew we were in over our heads. We would look to our side and see a drop that could kill and kept going. We made it a bit higher and it was much better because there were a lot of trees so if you fell you would smack against a few things and break a bone but not die. Which is nice. We made it to the top of the hill and it started to rain so hard we took shelter, then the fun part happened. The way down. The way down was much worse than the way up one because it was rainy as poo and everything is now mud, good luck turning or maintaining control on that. Secondly due to the steepness of the hill you could really get cooking down the hill. As this is my first time mountain biking I fell quite a few times and was being quite “reckless” on the mountain but if you aint falling ya aint trying. I fell about 6 or 7 times and ditched landing on the path (thank god) </p>
