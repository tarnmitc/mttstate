		<h1>Nursing: the Profession  cont.</h1>
    
    <p>How do you go about analyzing something so intricate? Jeannette O’Berski, a former teacher of nursing at MSU and a current nurse also described, “I first look at the summary or introduction and conclusion to get the main points, then I skim through the rest of it and I expect my students to do the same.”  Dr. Tarn goes on to add, “Medical School requires not much writing but a tremendous volume of reading textbooks and research papers.  One must become very efficient at honing the skills of determining what is important information and what may be filler.  This process begins in undergrad and is crucial as a student advances in their chosen Healthcare field” Medical papers and lab reports tell you everything you need to know to replicate the experiment for yourself but, in no case will you be doing this. Therefore you are reading for purpose. Above all, the thing that matters is the grade you get. Medical school is tedious and you will not remember everything Dr. Tarn has described it as Memorization and deletion. “One of the first things I look at now when analyzing a research paper is who funded the study. I want to know if there are any financial biases potentially involved with the results. Secondly I want to know the 'N' number or total study participants.  Is that a representative population sample that is statistically significant in its total number? Type of study? Double-blind, placebo, controlled etc. Where was the study done?” Through technical readings students can begin to understand some of the basics of how the body works. By building knowledge of material and readings one can form a concrete understanding of life and the human body. </p>
    <p>There is not much writing in college as a Nursing student. Writing classes are required by the university to graduate. To graduate with a BSN you need to take a writing class, this entails writing essays about various topics; along with classes you must be proficient at writing to communicate professionally.</p>
    <p>Success in school</p>
    <p>Nursing is competitive and rigorous schooling that must be taken seriously. There are defining factors that all successful nursing students have Mrs. O’Berski explained, “Common characteristics of successful students are people who are organized, prepared and conscientious.” As a teacher Mrs. O’Berski knows what they expect, “My expectations were that my students were prepared with the materials that were assigned. Much of what I taught required the student to read before class so they were prepared to participate in class discussion and activity.” Knowing what the professor expects of you is one major advancement to doing well in the class. Students already have a lot on their plates and must do well with it but there is always room for improvement, “The best advised I’d give a pre-nursing student is to be organized because nursing is a demanding and competitive program. Staying organized and getting assignments done on time helps to reduce stress.” By staying organized pre-nursing students can get things done on time and make sense of their busy schedules. </p>
    <p>As an occupation, all about the grade to all about the patient. </p>
    <p>Nursing immediately moves out of the text books and into the real world with patient doctor relations. Bedside manor is a very important part to a good healthcare experience. Something not as easy as one might think. The patient is already on edge as they are hours away from being under the knife while you try to be nice and discreetly extort the information you need to get out of them to make surgery go smoothly. Karen Bonney is a registered nurse at Port Huron Hospital where she has worked for over 30 years.  “How they (the patients) are treated seems to mean the most to them and that is what matters most to us as nurses.”  Nursing is not simply administering treatment. Ask any doctor or someone who has been injured. The fight is just as much mental as it is physical. “On occasion, patients will complain about their care because they are not satisfied, but this pushes the nurse to try harder to make sure the patient is content.“ as a nurse it is their responsibility to take notice and react to changes in the patients physical, mental and spiritual health ensuring an all around ‘enjoyable’ medical experience. Without nurses and doctors taking care of the mental struggle the patient is going through the health of the patient would also decrease. </p> 
    <p>Reading in the nursing profession ranges from job to job examples include looking up a certain disease to become more familiar with it before your patient has surgery or staying up to date on medical advancements along with filling out patient charts. One way that doctors and nurses do this is through medical magazines like Doctormag. Magazine and newspaper articles are a good source of information and summarize research papers and scholarly journals for the reader. An article titled “Better Medical Treatment, Not Better Lifestyles Is Reason For Drop In Heart Disease Deaths”. This magazine article specifies that only 25% of the heart disease decline has come from people stopping habits like smoking and drinking. It continues to say that 400,000 people die each year from heart disease and accounts for one third of all deaths. This is important for someone like a nurse to know so they can prioritize what they tell the patient and provide better health care, like checkups every month after surgery to see if the patient has changed lifestyle. Newspaper and magazine articles are a good way for medical professionals to get condensed and concise information without reading something as tedious and time consuming as a research paper. “The focus of my interest changed (when I entered the work force) from more broadly based scientific research to narrowly focused clinical studies in my field. I want to keep up on the latest and greatest in Anesthesia and information that actually impacts my delivery of anesthetic care to my patients… While in Medical School I might look at major academic research institutions work on the physiology of rat tendons.  Not anymore.  I prefer hospital/operating room based studies that involve topics I am involved with on a daily basis that I can use to improve my practice”</p>
