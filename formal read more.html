		<h1>A Sustanable Tomorrow cont.</h1>
    
    <p>So what does all this big spending mean? It means subsidized oil and gas keeping the companies revenue high, and the consumer cost low. Therefore alternative energies are not pushed by consumers so nothing is achieved. It means a lawless and deregulated oil industry. One in witch another disaster is not probable but definite. There is a serious lack of attention to the corruption of the government and a blind eye to the evilness of the oil industry. The government has a responsibility to protect the people but the people have a responsibility to overthrow the government when it does not do its job. So who can we blame but ourselves? This self-absorbed thinking can be defined as the dominant social paradigm. </p>
    <p>The dominant social paradigm in short is boiled down to a two simple concepts. The view that humans are superior to all other species and the Earth provides unlimited resources for humans. This way of thinking is toxic to the earth and will lead to a collapse of mankind. If you do not believe me take a look around you. </p>
    <p>Humans have taken this planet and see it as theirs to rule without halter. There is a phenomenon known as the tragedy of the commons. The tragedy of the commons is a “depletion of a shared resource by individuals acting independently and rationally according to each one's self-interest, despite their understanding that depleting the common resource is contrary to the group's long-term best interests.” This is evident in many places such as a vandalized public restrooms or water well. On a larger scale we can talk about air pollution, waterways and national parks. We use this world and put nothing back in it. We have manufactured metals and machines running off oil we have pulled deep within the earth. We are unnatural being that cultivate, and return relics not to be broken down, used or recycled by Mother Nature for thousands of years. Being a creature that does not outweigh cattle in biomass we are truly remarkable forces of destruction. For years we have exhibited exponential harvesting of natural resources. Natural resources are limited and will run out if we keep using them like we are.</p>
    <p>There’s no denial that humans think that we are the superior species after all, look at where we are compared to others. We are so much further ahead! How can one argue an ape has the same contribution to this world as us? Do monkeys have cars? Dr. Sagan said, “It is of interest to note that while some dolphins are reported to have learned English, up to fifty words used in correct context, no human being has been reported to have learned dolphinese.” These other species are just as important and we are denying their interactions with us. We justify our lack of action with “They are not a workhorse they can not do anything for us” Humans are ignorant and evaluate on self worth not the worth of the things around them. Sometimes we forget that the earth is a living-breathing thing and we are just a blip on the ecological radar with an opportunity to change the future. Our impact on the future is still uncertain but we must remain humble and remember one thing; the world does not belong to man, man belongs to the world. </p>
    <p>Fixing the dominant social paradigm and the environment is not easy and non apparent. It’s only the keen that observe critical changes in the environment. When looking out onto the golf of Mexico in 2010 everything looked fine, water blue, fish swimming, dolphins in the waves, until a man noticed the dolphins coughing. This was an enlightening moment for him when he realized that the environment is much more complex than realized. I agree with him but change is necessary and “how do we fix the environment” is a daunting question. It needs to be attacked on many fronts. Our efforts should be focused on protection, conservation, and education of the environment. </p>
