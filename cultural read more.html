		<h1>Past and Present</h1>
    
    <p>They say that ACL recovery takes six months to a year. I was determined to, yet again, push the limits of my body. I was better in four and ran the tough mudder at six (12 miles of 25 military obstacles).. But tearing my ACL did not start my interest in the medical field. My dad is an anesthesiologist, as a child he took me into his work and I saw how everyone liked him and the skeletons on the walls. I was hooked. Ever since that day I was waiting until I turned 16 so I could go and watch some surgeries. Shortly there after I watched a total knee, total hip, and an open-heart surgery. I could not describe my excitement and amazement as I watched someone’s chest being sawed open to save their life. Not only that but seeing the beating thing that is keeping us alive. All I could think is “I’m staring at someone’s function of life… lemmy touch it”. Without the technology we have today these things would not be possible. Technology has affected my life tremendously and will be something I use every day.</p>
    <p>You always hear about people getting into bad crashes and change how they view life. I thought I would be the person to live through other people and take away the lessons not needing that kind of change. But walking? My god I never thought that would be taken away from me. This group of people helped me walk again. That is something I can not repay. It truly is a gift to be able to walk again and I would like to be apart of these miracles of surgeries on people to let them experience the new found joy I have</p>
    <p>This team of medical professionals restored and massively improved my quality of life. I would love to do the same to others in my future and work on the ones that truly deserve the best care. As being a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists in the United States Army I will be serving my country and fixing those who give the ultimate sacrifice. </p>
    <p>Side note</p>
    <p>I have been dating my girlfriend for a year now and helped me through this. She likes to do this thing where whenever it’s raining she goes outside and dances. I have never been much of a dancer. One day it starts to rain we go outside I put on some tunes and I don’t dance. Why in the hell did I not dance! Looking back at it that could have been my last chance. Now I have a rule in my life. If someone asks me to dance, I have to dance. Life is to short not to do things like it is your last time. After all it very well could be. (Now we swing dance every week)</p>
