		<h1>Past and Present</h1>
    <p>My life is no doubt an interesting one.  I have had many experiences that have shaped my character. Rough times in life where I have proved who I truly am as well as good times where I have had to help others. </p>
    <p>Football was a very important part of my life, one that I lived for. Every snap every down was one that I cherished. I worked very hard. I earned a starting position on offence and defense and squatted 450 pounds. Flash forward to the state regional game, the semi finals. Start of the game I’m playing defensive end and come off the ball. Barley any contact… I take a step and feel my foot plant. Moments later I feel my knee shift. My foot is facing forward and my kneecap has made a 90-degree turn to the outside. I collapse, down on the field I am very aware what occurred. My knee is done. Everything that I have worked for and everything building up to this, gone. I could not let that happen, amidst the pain I knew I could not let that happen. Fists in the ground I got up. </p>
    <p>Still in the game, still in pain, ten seconds left. We are up by three the opposing team is on our 30 yard line. I go to step and the same thing happens again but this time it feels as if my knee did a 180. “AAAHHHH!!!” is the only thing I remember. I could have played 5 games like that. The real pain came when they told me I tore my ACL. Tearing my ACL allowed me to get very close and understanding medicine as well as rehabilitation techniques. I learned what would happen to me in my surgery and it is simply amazing to me. Not only what happened under the knife but what happened in my body and how I got better.</p>
    <p>I started working right after I got done crying. Something was taken away from me that I loved so much and to put the chary on top, now I cant walk. My leg is swollen stump because my dumb ass decided to collapse on the field three times instead of come off.. I started my pre-hab, workouts before the surgery, things as simple as flexing a muscle. I can see myself now staring at my leg using all the power I have and my leg is not listening to me. “Flex your quad”. I may not have been able to but the words “I can’t” never came out of my mouth. What they are going to do to me is open my leg up drill two holes where my ACL use to be then go around to the back of my leg and take a part of my hamstring tendon. They will lay it out onto the table fold it over twice stick it through the holes in my knee and pull. They will then (with a tool made by black and decker) drill two screws to hold it in place. After 2 months my body accepts the graft and gives it a blood supply… How the hell am I suppose to recover from that. I have not even had surgery and cant use the thing. I can’t even get into bed by myself, I’m never going to be able to do the things I use to do.</p>
    <p>I had to relearn to do everything. Relearning to walk was hard and stressful. And relearning to run was more challenging still. As these problems came up I had questions. And I had a lot of time to think. I spent countless hours icing and upside down on the wall to get the swelling down. Why won’t my body listen to me? It’s due to muscle atrophy. Atrophy is the decrease in size and wasting of muscle tissue. The body is such an efficient machine it gets rid of the parts it can not use. Things like this fascinate me and other things that our body gets like energy, the manufacture of DNA and proteins and all of the pathways we use. I keep asking questions and the next one that really interests me is how do I not wake up during surgery? How do I not bleed out? How do these drugs work? For my procedure I had a special cocktail of drugs, one main one was Novocain. In my procedure I was given a type of anesthesia called a femoral nerve block. The doctor numbs an area in my inner hip using an ultrasound machine he sticks a big ol’ needle right next to my femoral nerve. He then injects Novocain into me surrounding the nerve. Novocain is a numbing agent and by pinpointing this one location I was not able to feel anything in my leg. With the help of Novocain and a million other little things that come together I am able to have a new anterior cruciate ligament and I cant wait to learn about them all. </p>
