          <h1>Blog 1</h1>
          <p>The Crystler commercial with Eminem was a successful commercial. This commercial used key aspects of film to achieve the purpose of people buying their cars. Some of these key aspects include Imagery the song choice and the voiceover chosen.
The use of imagery in this commercial included pictures of a broken busted town then moved into history showing pictures of people doing heavy work and slaving away and making cars how they did in the past the pivotal moment in the commercial is when ta picture of a monument is shown of a fist. Then from there on the images shown are of cars success and luxury.  It ends with a man pointing at the camera and says this is how Detroit does it. This man was a rapper and is a rags to riches story.
The incorporation of the song lose yourself by Eminem served a purpose in this video. The song is often referred to as a pump up song and was meant to energize the watchers and get them excited. The song started to play as the voiceover went from antagonizing to prideful adding that extra umph to the advertisements message 
The voiceover is one of the stronger points of the advertisement and has a building effect through out. It starts antagonizing and basically calls the watchers poor and useless. This part is phrased in the 3ed person and then the man talking switches to a prideful and exciting message of what Detroit has come from what the town is capable of and where crystler is going to take them. 
I would say that being from Michigan this advertisement served its purpose if I was from another state and did not care so much about Detroit I don’t think it would have the same effect. With this papers use of imagery voiceover and song choice the advertisement served its purpose and made the viewers feel renewed, hopeful and prideful of the newly rediscover city of Detroit.

Although I was quite sick and did not make it to class I still managed to get a group and get the ball rolling. We established a group message. Exchanged contact info and I also made a Google docs document to make sure we are all up to date on what everyone has to do. We divided the proposal into parts and peer reviewed. If there were any questions raised we took it to the group chat and solved the problem. The great thing about Google docs is that it updates in real time so you can see what others are typing on there at the same time you are. We also established a color-coding system to identify who wrote what. This worked really well and we are staying in constant contact as a group and have accountability of or rolls. Although we do not know what what or who’s project we are doing I am excited to see how this turns out I have some ideas of what I want to do that could be a good idea although I am not aware of how much technology has to be used in our video or if the camera and delivery of our assignment will fulfill the requirement. I missed class due to sickness and had to ask for an extension on my last paper. I was not happy about that I had to skip all my classes that day and I learned that missing three classes in one day sucks and puts you way behind the ball. Even though this is titled the remix project I hope I get to do something new and interesting. 
</p>
          <h1>Blog 3</h1>
          <p>We met today at south wonders hall. I had to ride my bike all the way across campus but I’m not complaining I have to do much worse for ROTC. We met to decide what paper we were going to do our project on. Adam had some good papers but they were going to be hard to film about. Jenna had some as well one of hers was about applications. She wrote her first paper about her future in making phone applications. Although that was a contender they were very happy and excited to do my first paper about tearing my ACL. Tearing my ACL was a moving experience and I wanted to focus on how it changed my view of life and what I now consider important. I had an idea of the project that we would go to nursing homes and ask those towards the end of their lives what was the most important aspect. Family, friends, experiences? But we are now doing my ACL and divided workloads. </p>
          <h1>Blog 4</h1>
          <p>Adam Jenna and I met again today to discuss more about actually doing something and getting something out there I would like to get something done and moving so we don’t get too far behind and end up scrambling. This time when we met we went to a coffee house I don’t really like coffee but I’m always down for a hot chocolate so it works for me. There were a lot of people there so I had to move a few tables around. I don’t think I got in anyone’s way and did not cause a disturbance until Adam helped me move it back and knocked over the chair at that point everyone looked over and things got a little bit awkward. Despite that we had a really good meeting we talked about what needed to be done I need to get all of the pictures video and anything I can get my hands on. Adam and Jenna are going to do the majority of the editing along with that I also have the responsibility to recorded my story and tell it to the camera.

</p>
          <h1>Blog 5</h1>
          <p>So I just recorded my story I am usually really good at telling stories but in this case I did not do so hot. I always feed of the energy that everyone else gives me. Just by looking at them I can tell if I need to rush through this part slow down get a little bit sappier that kind of thing. But when I’m looking at my own face the whole time I don’t really know what to say I just sit there and kind of look retarded and babble on. I still don’t think it is as bad as I think it is. There is prolly something they can use in there. In total I went on about this thing for 30 some minutes. And the video only needs to be 7 min long. That’s a lot of extra stuff. We have no shortage of material that is for sure. </p>
          <h1>Blog 6</h1>
          <p>Today was not as productive as I thought it was going to be in class. Jenna slept in and showed up late and Adam was out of the state for a swim meet. No big deal there was a lot of other things to do. Today I got a better feel for the final project and what needs to be done. I really did not know what Mrs. Daniels meant when she said make a class project. That last 30%. Now I know what is going on although the foreigners in the class don’t seem to understand. There are 5 groups 4 going over content and one designing the website. I am on the web development team with a guy that I just met in class for the first time today Brandon was his name. He makes websites for the university so I think we have our work cut out for us. He also said he was in Air Force ROTC. That’s pretty cool he said he was disqualified due to medical reasons his eye sight and mentioned he had been through 3 surgeries already. He looked fine to me! I don’t know what is wrong. He did not say I did not ask. </p>
          <h1>Blog 7</h1>
          <p>Met again today to go over the final product, our video, it looks a lot better than I thought it would. I did not look too grumpy on camera. I just got out of a long ROTC lab out in the woods that were very muddy and nasty. The weather was very hard to peg. One minute it was cold and snowing the next it was raining and warm. I have not run many STX lanes so I did not know what the terrain was going to be like. I packed a lot of different gear to accommodate the weather. Turned out it was swampy and hilly. So after I got back I was hauling all this gear to this meeting. Well anyway Jenna was questioning all that I was doing and we ate then got to work. As I said the video was not too bad but there was one small problem I thought you might get on us for. Jenna did not know how to overlay a photo with my voice so whenever a picture showed the audio stopped. I changed that so when a picture shows I continue to talk. Its really easy, all mac products are. Just select the clip and detach the audio then delete the video portion you don’t what to watch anymore and your voiceover is complete. Other than that everything looked great. I gave the editing team 40 min worth of footage and other video and picture for a 9 min video. So they had plenty to cut but also a lot of good stuff in there.   </p>
          <h1>Blog 8</h1>
          <p>The final project is coming along great and without any problem at all as there is a person in our group named Brandon a pretty cool guy he was in ROTC, air force but had a medical disqualification. I have not heard back from DODMER yet so I hope I don’t have one. Anyway he was pre med and somehow ended up being a web designer for the university. I have no idea what he is doing in WRA though. He did most of the work and designed a pretty good website that the design team is going to use as a template for the website. Nothing to hard about it. </p>
          <h1>Blog 9</h1>
          <p>Had class today! Last one. Overall I liked this course because I got to do something different and new.  I met some cool people that have similar interests to me. This class took a lot of work but it was really fun. Today in class we put our stuff online then I took pictures of each team with Brandon for the website. Today was really busy I was worried I was going to be late for class because I had a final right before my wra class and for some reason I was under the impression that we were going to present our videos today. That was a little bit of a relieve because I did not really want the whole class to have to watch me talk for 9 minutes. Today is going to be a long day but ill get through it. Currently juggling a lot. And with finals coming up I’m kind of stressing out. I wish I knew my grade in this class but I don’t know what I have gotten on my papers.</p>
          <h1>Blog 10</h1>
          <p>I’m excited for my future. I don’t know exactly where it is going to lead but I know it’s going to be fun and I know I am going to be successful. With ROTC I don’t know where I am going to go but life would be no fun if you knew exactly what was going to come next. One of the best things about coming to MSU is all the opportunities that I am getting by participating in clubs and things that I will never again have the opportunity or time to do like formula one club guitar club ski club hammock club and assassins club and many more that I am looking at joining. Coming from a little town this is a little overwhelming too. When I go someplace I am use to knowing every single person I come across. Not anymore I look around and I am lucky to see someone I recognize. With that there are also a lot of opportunities as well. Overall I will have money through my parents and through ROTC throughout college so I when I start getting paid then I will be able to do a lot of different things I would not normally have the money to do. </p>
          <h1>Blog 11</h1>
          <p>The subject we chose was easy in the sense that I lived it therefore I could, in effect, tell a story to the audience. We did not need to consult anyone or ask for a professional opinion on a complicated or in a morally gray field. What happened was fact and easy for me to portray to the camera. We used my story to compose more of a pathos personal narrative video. I’m sure other people learned from my story but looking back from watching the video now to when I did the recording, I barely remembered what I said. Watching it again and seeing the final product made me realize it was a bigger deal than I remember and brings back memories and emotions, both happy and sad. There were a few problems when we went to organize the material mainly the time constraint, because I told the full story to the camera and it was over 40 minutes long. Also we ran into problems tying to contact the doctor that preformed my surgery. We were hoping to contact him and have him explain the injury, the consequences on the body and what happens in the medical procedure he failed to contact us back. The audience was considered throughout because they are the ones we are making this for. We thought about how they are supposed to feel watching it and how to appeal to them. I chose to speak directly towards them and show a more personal side. We decided on a paper much easier than I thought we would. We looked at all the papers we had written made a list and Jenna and Adam both wanted to do the project about me, I was ok with it. The most challenging part of the project for me was to thoughtfully portray the emotions I felt during this time in my life and get the audience to react to it in some way. It was hard to remember everything what happened and when you go through not so great times in your life its something you try to remember. I took a chronological approach to telling my story although it was not as clear in the final editing. I’m not good enough to do flashbacks and foreshadowing in my verbal stories yet. </p>
          <h1>Blog 12</h1>
          <p>In our remix project research was not really used because I had done research before and after I had the procedure done. I knew all the accurate information prior to starting this project. The knowledge I obtained during my injury were all from scholarly resources like doctors and journals and things like physical therapy I picked up as I was participating in it. Our group was very well run. I took up most of the coordination. We constructed Google docs for real time editing and sharing we had imaginary or self set deadlines to keep the group on track and not pressed for time. We had a group chat and kept communication open throughout the project. In addition to staying in constant contact and holding others accountable for their work we met four times in person. Our project was done a week in advance. Something I wish we could have done differently is get the doctor to talk and get the clip of me tearing my ACL as the team was at the state finals this year and in season the coach did not have time to find the file for me, more than understandable. I was not in charge of design decisions that fell under the responsibility of Adam and Jenna although I would have to say the most effective piece of the documentary was the incorporation of photos giving the audience something tangible to attach themselves to and make the story real. Overall the outcome of the documentary was very successful we portrayed everything we strived to, all deadlines were met, and I think it is very effective. </p>
          <h1>Blog 13</h1>
          <p>My ideas of writing and personal literacy have changed over time. Once as simple as making it through a picture book now has turned into a complex and challenging discipline that kept me working. For me it is now something that I work on constantly storytelling has become an art. I am currently trying my hand at songwriting. Writing is something you will use every day of your life and will not go away. Writing is more than just scribbling down words mindlessly. It became a maze and a challenge to clearly portray ideas in your head as written word. This first year college writing course has helped me expand my horizon in this field and become more affluent and effective with written word. This class has encouraged me to keep writing outside of this class with setting up things like a blog and also taught me a slight understanding of a website. Thins class taught me how to set up a website and maintain one. </p>
          <h1>Blog 14</h1>
          <p>The purpose of the video
  The purpose of the video is to show there is help out there that killing yourself is not the only option and often a bad one leaving ripple effects and realizing that other people hurt because you are gone</p>
<p>How the video achieves its goal 
  The writer uses a personal narrative with pathos style writing. He appeals to their emotional side and gets the watchers/readers to react.</p> 

<p>The structure of the message
  He starts with a broad topic of how his mother thought about his uncle then moved into a more emotionally charged subject of gay discrimination and suicide. He focused on his uncle’s life then what happened after he was gone. He still addressed and spoke to his late uncle giving the narrative a unique perspective.</p>

<p>In my own writing
  I will use this example of a personal narrative in my paper to appeal more to the story telling perspective and use pathos writing more effectively. I have never written a personal narrative before and did not realize how personal we could get. I will revise my paper and make it more personal. </p>
          <h1>Blog 15</h1>
          <p>I believe that there is no correlation between Formal Education and Personal Success. You are dealt a hand in life and there is not much you can do to control that, but you control all additional hands and where you go from there. There is a correlation between Education and success though. The desire to learn is something you cannot teach and completely self-sustaining. Learning is like opening a door with endless doors after it. I learn about things all the time on the internet like sonoluminescence through educational avenues like youtube and tedtalks. I thought “wow sonoluminescence is really cool I wonder how it is applied.” From there I learned about cavitation. In summery small bubbles in the water that explode hotter than the sun formed by rapid movement of the water and can cause serious damage on things like boat propellers. The point is if you want to be successful in life you will be. Great visionaries like steve jobs, bill gates and mark zuckerberg did not finish college because they saw these doors, walked through them and just kept on walking. So now I ask myself why I am here. I want to be a CRNA in the US Army a practicing doctor needs a degree. So in somecases yes you need school to land a job and make money contributing to personal success but most times no you do not. You need to be driven by the desire to learn and not be faulted by failure. </p>
